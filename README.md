# Apple Voice Memos Claude Skill

Extract and process transcripts from Apple Voice Memos synced via iCloud.

## Installing this skill

You can install this skill into Claude Code, Gemini, Cursor, and other agents that support the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) format:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/jessedc/apple-voice-memos --skill apple-voice-memos
```

If you get the error `npx: command not found`, you need to install Node first:

```bash
brew install node
```

When using `npx`, you can select whether the skill should be installed just for one project or made available for all your projects.

Alternatively, you can clone this repository or download a release and install it however you like. 

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Voice Memos iCloud sync enabled

## Using this skill

The skill is called Apple Voice Memos, and can be triggered in Claude Code:

> /apple-voice-memos

The skill walks you through three steps:

1. **Select** — Finds voice memos by recency, title search, or date range
2. **Extract** — Pulls the embedded transcript from the selected memo
3. **Process** — Sends the transcript to a subagent that produces structured notes with narrative summary, detailed notes, asides, and action items

You can also trigger the skill using natural language:

> Use the Apple Voice Memos skill to summarize my most recent voice memo.

## How It Works

Two Python scripts (standard library only, no dependencies):

- **`extract-apple-voice-memos-metadata`** — Queries the `CloudRecordings.db` SQLite database (read-only) for recording titles, dates, durations, and filenames. Supports filtering and pagination.
- **`extract-apple-voice-memos-transcript`** — Extracts transcript text from the `tsrp` atom embedded in `.m4a` files by Apple's on-device transcription. Adds timestamps, removes filler words, and inserts paragraph breaks at natural pauses.

Transcripts are extracted from the `.m4a` files present on your machine, no audio is processed.

## Example prompts

> I recorded some thoughts on a walk yesterday, can you transcribe and summarize them?

> I have a voice memo from a meeting last week — can you turn it into notes with action items?

> I rambled into my phone about a project idea recently, help me make sense of it.

> Summarize my latest voice memo and save it as a markdown file.
